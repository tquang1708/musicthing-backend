## WIP senior project - Backend

### Installation

This project was built on Postgres 13.6 and Rust 1.59.0. I might add an option to install from Docker for comfort but I can't get it to work on my machine.

In the meantime, **simply executing `install.sh`** should install the database as well as everything on your own system while also launching the backend itself.
